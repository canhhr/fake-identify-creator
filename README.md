👉 Usage;

👉  The "Fake Identity Creator" program is a tool that provides you with temporary, detailed, and comprehensive fake identities for use in OSINT and similar operations. Before generating a fake identity, you need to select the age range and gender. The result screen displays the generated fake identity's name, surname, date of birth, age, phone number, email address, country information, and address details. You can process these information however you like and use them comfortably in your OSINT or related tasks. If you need to close the program but still want to continue using the generated fake identity information, you can click on the "SAVE" button located at the bottom left, and the information of the created fake identity will be saved to the location of the application. The application is for educational purposes only, and we are not responsible for the actions you perform with this information. Sample pictures;
